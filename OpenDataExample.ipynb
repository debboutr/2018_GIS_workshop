    "_Under the [Safe and Sustainable Water Resources Research Program](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-safe-and-sustainable-water-resources-research-program), EPA scientists are examining the temporal and spatial patterns of drinking water nitrate violations across the United States. Excess nitrate in drinking water has been a human health concern since the middle of the 20th century. Since 1979, public drinking water suppliers have been required to regularly monitor nitrate levels and EPA is notified when a public water system violates the 10 mg nitrate-N L-1 maximum contaminant level (MCL)._ **The study found an increase in the number and proportion of systems in violation for nitrate over time, nearly doubling from 280 to 527 systems from 1994 to 2010. This analysis identifies specific systems or locations that consistently experience violations of the nitrate MCL or where there are higher populations served by systems in violations, which can then inform management strategies. Currently, it is not fully known what is causing this increase in nitrate violations in drinking water supplies. This analysis, along with future research on the underlying factors driving the violations, may inform decisions on how treatment, source water protection, and other management options could best protect drinking water from nitrate contamination.** _The results of this study could be important for a number of programs within EPA’s Office of Groundwater and Drinking Water, Regions, and States. This abstract contributes to SSWR4.03C and SSWR3.01B._\n",
